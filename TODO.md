# TODO

## Add configuration file
Add the abilty to specify defaults, such as directional settings, in a configuration file

## Add ability to process folder/multiple GPX files
Add the ability to process an entire folder or specify multiple GPX files.  Also include the parameter to create separate output files or join into a single output file.  Possibly use parameter: -1 for single file?

## Add ability to "merge" tracks
Tracks could be merged either within a single file or across multiple files

## Add detection of secondary track crossing/junctions
Use a boundary around the "main" track and determine if a point falls within the bounds.
